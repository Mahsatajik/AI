### Artificial Intelligence Course

## Overview

This repository contains my computer assignments (CAs) for the Artificial Intelligence course I completed at the University of Tehran. Throughout this course, I explored various machine learning algorithms and techniques, including linear regression, decision trees, random forests, K-nearest neighbors (KNN), text processing with the NLTK library, and handling image data. Additionally, I implemented search algorithms like BFS, and worked with Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib.
